GPL Beer

This software is free as in beer. This is to say that if you find this useful, you should buy me a beer next time you see me. And a good beer, if you want it to get better. If you don’t want it to get better, buy me a crappy beer. If you don’t see me, buy yourself a beer. Or a soda if you don’t drink beer. Or a water if you don’t drink soda. If you don’t drink water, then you don’t need to spend your last remaining moments on the planet thanking me. Instead, you should spend them drinking water so they’re not your last remaining moments on the planet and then you can buy me a beer. Not that I only want you to be a live for your ability to buy me beer. I’m sure you have many better contributions to the world to make than buying me a beer. However, I do think that doing I could take a huge, awesome benefit to your existence having a cold frothy beverage from you in my hand. 

Reuse and alteration. If you reuse the code here and alter it, then you should be a good person and commit it back up. Some people can’t, and I get that. So no worries if you don’t. But it’s a cool thing to do. And future proofs you. And might end up with me buying you a beer. And likely a good beer. Unless you don’t like good beer. No judgement if you don’t like good beer. OK, total judgement. Kinda’ like you’re probably judging my code right now. Don’t judge. Just make better.
